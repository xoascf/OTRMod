{app} is a versatile tool for creating .otr mods for the PC port of The
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, known as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Harkinian[Ship of Harkinian]. It
simplifies the process of creating and exporting features from other N64
ROMs and custom content into SoH.

== Introduction
With its scripting language and really simple web interface, {app}
allows you to create mods that change textures, music sequences, in-game
text and much more, here are some of the features it offers:

* *Scripting Language*: {app} features a scripting language that
enables advanced mod creation and manipulation, allowing you to import
custom sequences, textures, game text, and more from N64 Zelda ROMs.
* *Web Interface*: Access {app} through the web interface at
https://soh.xoas.eu.org[soh.xoas.eu.org] for a user-friendly experience
without downloading the CLI.
* *Command-Line Interface (CLI)*: The CLI provides additional
functionality like .ootrs (Ocarina of Time Randomizer Sequence)
conversion and standalone ROM decompression.

== Usage Examples
* {app} enabled the

translation by eduardo_a2j] for its use in SoH and featured in streams
by Rubius on Twitch (watch his full walkthrough on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM98fQFQYc8[YouTube]).
* ROMHack translations into Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Russian, and
other languages have also been ported by the

script].
* Some non-English-speaking Ocarina of Time fans on
https://discord.com/invite/shipofharkinian[Discord] and beyond have been
enjoying reliving the game in their languages thanks to {app}.

== Planned Features
There are exciting plans for the future of {app}, including:

* Downloadable GUI tool
* Texture conversion from PNG to game format and vice versa
* Custom audio bank/soundfont support
* Explore mod content in the web application
* Modify game scripts completely through the web app editor

Stay tuned for updates!

=== Related Tool: Retro
You might also be interested in exploring another tool created by the
original developers called Retro. Retro allows for HD textures from
PNGs, custom sequences (from the unzipped content of .ootrs), custom
debug menu fonts, and the ability to inspect .otr files. While Retro and
{app} share some common functionalities, they cater to different
aspects of modding. You can find Retro on GitHub at
https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro.

*Friendly reminder*:

IMPORTANT: Sharing the generated .otr files is discouraged if they are
created from a ROM or copyrighted file. To ensure legal use of the
generated mods share the script and the corresponding ROM hashes.

NOTE: Donâ€™t forget to visit the
https://gamebanana.com/games/16121[GameBanana] page to download really
nice .otr mods!

Harkinian experience!

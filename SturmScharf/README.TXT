SturmScharf
===========

SturmScharf is a .NET library for working with MPQ/OTR files based on War3Net.IO.Mpq.

Main changes:
- Renamed to "Sturm" (in honor of Storm.dll) + "Sharp" (after C#) in German.
- Dependencies on LINQ removed.
- Updated to work with .NET Framework 4.0.
- Standardized line endings to LF when listing files for cross-platform consistency.
- Reworked code style and removed StyleCop rules.
- Tests are heretical so they were dropped.
- Game public keys are not required for OTR handling, so they have also been removed.
